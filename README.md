# Learning Bayesian Networks from Data
### By using Maximum LikelyhoodEstimate/Mutual Information Gain and Max. Spanning Tree
### Bayesian network:
Bayesian network(BN) is one of probabilistic model which can be used for solving those problem where outcome is non-deterministic and we need to use proablistic query to find the outcome. BN is Directed Acyclic graph where each node in the graph can represent either a random variable, Factor, or a cluster of random variables. Edges in the graph represent the dependencies between these. WE can do Causal/Predictive/Diagnostic/Inter-causal kind of queries.In current blog queries are out of scope. This will be discussed seperatly in diffrent blog.
